# MTLS
Repository for Project in molecular Life science 

Hello!

<<<<<<< HEAD

Go to projects -> general_scripts.

Once there, run Predict.py. It would load a trained model with the best parameters found so far (C=1, kernel=linear, sliding window=35)


If you want to train again the model, use Training.py.
=======
The latest changes are in project. I know it is a mess right now, but I will classify everything in functions this following week.
